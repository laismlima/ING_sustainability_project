32,1,Limited assurance report issued  . by independent  auditors
32,0.84,To the Board of Directors and Shareholders  . O Boticario Franchising Ltda.  . Curitiba - PR
32,0.64,"Introduction. We have been engaged by O Boticario Franchising Ltda. (“Grupo Boticário” or “Company”)  to apply . limited assurance procedures on the sustainability information disclosed in Grupo  Boticário’s 2020 . Impact Report (“Report”) attached in this report, related to the year ended  December 31st, 2020.  ."
32,0.76,"Responsibilities of Grupo Boticário’s Management  . The Management of Grupo Boticário is responsible for adequately preparing and presenting  the . sustainability information in the 2020’s Impact Report in accordance with the internal  controls . determined necessary to ensure this information is free from material  misstatement, resulting from . fraud or error."
32,0.44,"Independent auditors’ responsibility. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion about the information in the Report based on a  limited . assurance engagement conducted in accordance with Technical Communication  (TC) 07/2012, . which was prepared based on NBC TO 3000 (Assurance Engagements  Other Than Audits and . Reviews), both issued by the Brazilian Federal Accounting Council -  CFC equivalent to international . standard ISAE 3000, issued by the International Federation  of Accountants and applicable to Non-. Financial Historical Information. These standards  require compliance with ethical requirements, . including independence ones, and the  engagement is also conducted to provide limited assurance . that the information disclosed  in the Report, taken as a whole, is free from material misstatement."
32,0.52,A limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with NBC TO 3000 (ISAE 3000)  consists . mainly of questions and interviews with the Management of Grupo Boticário and  other professionals . of the Company involved in the preparation of the information disclosed  in the Report and use of . analytical procedures to obtain evidence that enables us to reach a  limited assurance conclusion . about the sustainability information taken as a whole. A  limited assurance engagement also requires . additional procedures when the independent  auditor acknowledges issues which may lead them . to believe that the information disclosed  in the Report taken as a whole could present material . misstatement.
32,0.24,"The selected procedures were based on our understanding of the issues related to the  compilation, . materiality and presentation of the information disclosed in the Report, on other  engagement"
32,0.8,circumstances and also on our considerations regarding areas and processes associated with . material sustainability information disclosed where relevant misstatement  could exist. The procedures . consisted of:
32,0.6,"a. . engagement planning: consideration of the relevancy, consistency, quantitative information  . and the operational systems and internal controls that served as a basis for preparation of  the . information in the Grupo Boticário’s Report;"
32,0.4,b. . understanding and review of calculation methodologies and information consolidation  . procedures through interviews with the managers responsible for preparing the Report;
32,0.32,c. . application of analytical procedures on the quantitative information disclosed in the Report;
32,0.36,d. . analysis of evidences (sampling based) supporting the disclosed information.
32,0.56,"We believe that the information, evidence and results we have obtained are sufficient and  appropriate . to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion."
32,0.68,"Scope and limitations . The procedures applied to a limited assurance engagement are substantially less extensive  than . those applied to a reasonable assurance engagement. Therefore, we cannot provide  reasonable . assurance that we are aware of all the issues that would have been identified in  a reasonable . assurance engagement, which aims to issue an opinion. If we had conducted  a reasonable assurance . engagement, we may have identified other issues and possible  misstatements within the information . presented in the Report."
32,0.28,"Nonfinancial data is subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, due to the  nature and . diversity of the methods used to determine, calculate or estimate these data.  Qualitative interpretation . of the data’s materiality, relevance and accuracy are subject to  individual assumptions and judgments. . Additionally, we have not examined data related to  prior periods, to evaluate the adequacy of policies, . practices and sustainability  performance, nor future projections."
32,0.72,"Conclusion. Based on the procedures performed, described in this report, we have not identified any  relevant . information that leads us to believe that the information in Grupo Boticário’s 2020  Impact Report is . not fairly stated in all material aspects in accordance with the Standards  for Sustainability Report of . Global Reporting Initiative - GRI (GRI- Standards) and with the  records and files that served as the . basis for its preparation."
