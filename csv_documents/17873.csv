Our objective is to deliver a premier customer. experience by providing high quality, innovative products and designing solutions that enhance and optimize our. customers' businesses. As a railcar focused company, we see opportunities to grow and enhance our product and. service offerings in ways that we expect will optimize the ownership and use of railcars. Our rail platform offers a. complete portfolio of railcar solutions to our customers as summarized below:"
8,1.0,"Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. Our Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. (Leasing Group) is a leading provider in North America of comprehensive railcar industry services. Through wholly-. owned subsidiaries, primarily Trinity Industries Leasing Company (TILC), and partially-owned subsidiaries, TRIP Rail. Holdings LLC (“TRIP Holdings”) and RIV 2013 Rail Holdings LLC (RIV 2013), we primarily offer operating leases for. freight and tank railcars. Trinity's Rail Products Group and TILC coordinate sales and marketing activities under the. TrinityRail platform, thereby providing a single point of contact for railroads and shippers seeking rail equipment and. services."
8,0.5,"In addition, TILC originates and manages railcar leases for third-party investors and provides fleet maintenance and. management services to industrial shippers. Our affiliations with third-party investor-owned funds, through strategic. railcar alliances and the formation of railcar investment vehicles, combined with TILC's fleet maintenance and. management services capabilities, complement our leasing business by generating stable fee income, strengthening. customer relationships, and enhancing the view of TrinityRail as a leading provider of railcar products and services."
8,0.75,"The railcars in our lease fleet are leased to industrial shippers and railroads. These companies operate in various. markets including agriculture, construction and metals, consumer products, energy, and refined products and. chemicals. Substantially all of the railcars in our lease fleet were manufactured by our Rail Products Group. The terms. of our railcar leases generally vary from one to ten years, although certain leases entered into in prior periods had. lease terms of up to twenty years, and provide for fixed monthly rentals, predominantly under full-service leases. A. small percentage of our fleet is leased on a per diem basis. As of December 31, 2019, the lease fleet of our subsidiaries. included 103,705 railcars that were 96.0% utilized, of which 101,530 railcars were owned by TILC or its affiliates and. 2,175 railcars were financed in sale-leaseback transactions, which are not reflected in the property, plant, and equipment. amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Railcars under management, including those owned by third-. parties, totaled 128,540 railcars."

10,0.6,"We believe that our Rail Products Group's diversified manufacturing capabilities enable us to capitalize on changing. industry trends and developing opportunities in various markets. Additionally, we offer a full range of maintenance. services and flexible solutions, from field inspections and comprehensive compliance testing to standard repairs and. maintenance, specialized cleaning, inspection, and testing at multiple facilities in the U.S. We also provide modification. capabilities and assist in transitioning railcars to new industry standards. We believe that our investment in maintenance. services expands and enhances our ability to serve our customers and our lease fleet."
10,0.85,"Our customers include railroads, leasing companies, and industrial shippers of products in various markets, such. as agriculture, construction and metals, consumer products, energy, and refined products and chemicals. We compete. in the North American market primarily against four major railcar manufacturers and numerous maintenance services. providers."
10,0.25,"We hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcars and components. We believe patents offer. a marketing advantage in certain circumstances. No material revenues are received from the licensing of these patents."
10,0.7,"All Other. All Other includes our highway products business; our logistics business; legal, environmental, and. maintenance costs associated with non-operating facilities; and other peripheral businesses."
10,0.55,"Our highway products business is a leading U.S. manufacturer of guardrail, crash cushions, and other highway. barriers. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which determines product eligibility for cost reimbursement. using federal funds, has approved many of our products as eligible for federal-aid reimbursement based on satisfactory. performance testing pursuant to criteria established under either the National Cooperative Highway Research Program. Report 350 or the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware, as applicable. Our crash cushion, barrier, and guardrail. product lines include multiple proprietary products manufactured under license from certain public and private research. organizations and inventors as well as Company-held patents. We sell highway products throughout the U.S., Canada,. and Mexico, and we export highway products, including proprietary products, internationally. We do not perform any. installation services with respect to our highway products. Our highway products business is affected by seasonal. fluctuations, with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues."

The change in backlog as of December 31, 2019 compared with our backlog as. of December 31, 2018 reflects the value of orders taken, net of cancellations, executory contract change orders and. price modifications, and orders delivered during the year. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully. supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount of backlog attributable to the Leasing. Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may choose to purchase railcars from the Rail Products Group. rather than lease. Approximately 59% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the year ending. December 31, 2020 with the remainder to be delivered through 2023."
10,0.9,"Marketing. We sell or lease substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating. from offices in multiple U.S locations as well as Canada and Mexico. We also use independent sales representatives. on a limited basis."
10,0.2,"7"
11,0.5,"Raw Materials and Suppliers."
11,0.75,"Railcar Specialty Components and Steel. Products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a. significant supply of raw materials, such as steel, as well as numerous specialty components, such as brakes, wheels,. heads, side frames, bolsters and bearings. The input costs for materials, including raw steel, specialty components,. and other parts and coatings purchased from third parties represent, on average, more than 70% of the cost of most. railcars. Although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years, at least. two suppliers continue to produce most components."
11,0.5833333333333334,"The principal material used in railcar manufacturing is steel. During 2019, the supply of steel was sufficient to support. our manufacturing requirements. Market steel prices continue to exhibit periods of volatility and were slightly lower. exiting 2019 compared to 2018. Steel and component prices may be volatile in the future as a result of market conditions,. changes in tariffs or other governmental policies. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier. commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect. of steel price volatility on our operating profits for the year. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply. industry to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will. meet our current production forecasts."

12,0.9,"Mr. Mauer has been in full time employment of Trinity or its subsidiaries for more than five years and has performed. essentially the same duties during the past five years."
12,0.4,"9"
13,0.3,"Commitment to Sustainability. We strive to employ company resources in ways that make positive contributions. to our stakeholders. As we pursue improvements to our products and services, we keep in mind the environmental. and societal impacts of our decisions and work to protect natural resources and the environment for the benefit of. current and future generations. We continuously look for ways to improve our governance practices with the goal of. promoting the long-term interests of stakeholders, strengthening accountability and inspiring trust."
13,0.2,"Environmental Stewardship. We aim to operate our business in a manner that minimizes the impact on natural. resources and the environment. We believe railcars are a more environmentally friendly way to fuel the North American. supply chain. U.S. freight railroads produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than certain other modes of commercial. transportation, such as trucks. We strive to responsibly support customers' products at each stage of the product. lifecycle, including recycling the railcar through scrap and salvage at the end of its useful life."
13,0.9,"Social Responsibility. Our goal is to add value to the communities in which we live and work, strengthening our. relationships and leveraging our partnerships to amplify our impact. We strive to attract and retain a diverse and. empowered workforce. Our priorities include fostering an inclusive and collaborative workplace, promoting opportunities. for professional development, improving the wellbeing of our employees and other stakeholders, and contributing to. the communities in which we operate."
13,1.0,"Governance. Our goal is to promote the long-term interests of stakeholders, strengthen accountability, and inspire. trust. Our Board of Directors includes an independent Chairman and diverse and independent Board members who. help ensure that our business strategies and programs, including our compensation program, are aligned with. stakeholder interests."
13,0.5,"Governmental Regulation."
13,0.4,"Railcar Industry. Our railcar and related manufacturing, maintenance services, and leasing businesses are. regulated by multiple governmental regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA);. Transport Canada (TC); the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the administrative agencies it. oversees, including the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety. Administration (PHMSA), the Research and Special Programs Administration; Mexico's Agencia Reguladora del. Transporte Ferroviario; Mexico's Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes; and industry authorities such as the. Association of American Railroads (AAR). All such agencies and authorities promulgate rules, regulations,. specifications or operating standards affecting railcar design, configuration, and mechanics; maintenance, and rail-. related safety standards for railroad equipment, tracks, and operations, including the packaging and transportation of. hazardous or toxic materials. We believe that our product designs and operations are in compliance with these. specifications, standards, and regulations applicable to our business."
13,0.6,"Revised regulations implemented in 2015 pertaining to the transportation of flammable materials by rail remain in. effect. These regulatory changes materially impact: the rail industry as a whole; railroad operations; older and newer. tank railcars that met or exceeded prior regulatory requirements and standards; future tank railcar specifications; and. market decisions relative to capital investment in rail products."
13,0.8,"Highway Products. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of highway products. manufacturers are the USDOT, the FHWA, and various state highway departments and administrative agencies. These. organizations, with participation from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. (AASHTO), establish certain specifications, product testing criteria, and performance standards related to the. manufacture of our highway products. We believe that our highway products are in compliance with the standards and. specifications applicable to our business."
13,0.7,"Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Similar Regulations. Our operations are subject to. regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the. Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (STPS) in Mexico. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to. protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed. at our facilities. However, claims that may be asserted against us for work-related illnesses or injury and the further. adoption of occupational safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could. increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in. substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of. compliance."
13,0.1,"10"
14,0.7142857142857143,"Environmental Matters. We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws. and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, processing,. handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and materials; and other activities. relating to the protection of human health, natural resources, and the environment."
14,0.7857142857142857,"Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations.. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our. operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations. We. believe that our operations and facilities, whether owned, managed, or leased, are in substantial compliance with. applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non-compliance is not likely to have a material adverse. effect on our operations or financial condition."

14,0.35714285714285715,"Our business is subject to a number of risks, which are discussed below. There are risks and uncertainties that. could cause our actual results to be materially different from those mentioned in forward-looking statements that we. make from time to time in filings with the SEC, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements, and. other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking statements made from time to time by representatives. of our Company. All known material risks and uncertainties are described below. You should consider carefully these. risks and uncertainties in addition to the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC. including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, and any amendments thereto before deciding to buy, sell,. or hold our securities. If any of the following known risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects. on us, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or liquidity could be harmed. In that event, the market. price for our various securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment."
14,0.8571428571428571,"The cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition,. operating results, and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.

14,0.6428571428571429,"Risks Related to our Business"
14,1.0,"The industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the. economy."
14,0.5714285714285715,"We operate in cyclical industries. Periodic downturns in economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect. on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products. Decreased demand could result. in lower sales volumes, lower prices, and/or a decline in or loss of profits. The railcar industry has previously experienced. sharp cyclical downturns and at such times operated with a minimal backlog. While the business cycles of our different. operations may not typically coincide, an economic downturn could affect disparate cycles simultaneously. The impacts. of such an economic downturn may magnify the adverse effect on our business."
14,0.9285714285714286,"Volatility in the global markets or in industries that our products serve may adversely affect our business. and operating results."
14,0.5,"Instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our. products serve, fluctuations in commodity prices that our customers produce and transport, changes in legislative or. trade policy, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or adverse changes in the financial. condition of our customers could lead to customers' requests for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders. Additionally,. such events could result in our customers' attempts to unilaterally cancel or terminate firm contracts or orders in whole. or in part, resulting in contract or purchase order breaches and increased commercial litigation costs. Such occurrences. could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations."
15,0.6363636363636364,"If volatile conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers' access to credit, product order volumes. may decrease or customers may default on payments owed to us. Likewise, if our suppliers face challenges obtaining. credit, selling their products to customers that require purchasing credit, or otherwise operating their businesses, the. supply of materials we purchase from them to manufacture our products may be interrupted. Any of these conditions. or events could result in reductions in our revenues, increased price competition, or increased operating costs, which. could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition."
15,0.36363636363636365,"Litigated disputes and other claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition."
15,0.7272727272727273,"We are currently, and may from time to time be involved in various claims or legal proceedings arising out of our. operations. Adverse judgments and outcomes in some or all of these matters could result in significant losses and. costs that could weaken our financial condition. Although we maintain reserves for our reasonably estimable liability,. our reserves may be inadequate to cover our portion of claims or final judgments after taking into consideration rights. in indemnity and recourse to third parties. As a result, there could be a material adverse effect on our business,. operations, or financial condition. See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. on any material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, including. the current status of the Company's highway products litigation."
15,0.45454545454545453,"While state and federal procedural rules exist to curtail the filing of claims against the Company in jurisdictions. unrelated to the underlying claims, courts sometime may not enforce these rules, exposing us to a greater likelihood. of unfavorable results and increased litigation costs. Whenever our products are sold to or ultimately owned and/or. operated by governments or their authorized agencies, we may be unable to seek redress or recourse to at-fault. parties. When litigation arising from the installation, maintenance, replacement, or use of our products is filed against. the Company, recourse to such governments or authorized agencies may be subject to sovereign immunity or related. defenses thereby exposing the Company to risk of liability and increased costs irrespective of fault."
15,0.2727272727272727,"Changes in the price and demand for steel could lower our margins and profitability."
15,0.9090909090909091,"The principal material used in our manufacturing segments is steel. Market steel prices may exhibit periods of. volatility. Steel prices may experience further volatility as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel mills and. other market factors. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, supplier commitments, contractual price. escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of this volatility on our operating. profits for the year. To the extent that we do not have such arrangements in place, a change in steel prices could. materially lower our profitability. In addition, meeting production demands is dependent on our ability to obtain a. sufficient amount of steel. An unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our. margins and production schedules."
15,0.18181818181818182,"We have potential exposure to environmental liabilities that may increase costs and lower profitability."
15,0.8181818181818181,"We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to:. (i) the release or discharge of materials into the environment at our facilities or with respect to our products while in. operation; (ii) the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous and non-. hazardous waste, substances, and materials; and (iii) other activities relating to the protection of human health and. the environment. Such laws and regulations expose us to liability for our own acts and in certain instances potentially. expose us to liability for the acts of others. These laws and regulations also may impose liability on us currently under. circumstances where at the time of the action taken, our acts or those of others complied with then applicable laws. and regulations. In addition, such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and are frequently. modified or revised to impose new obligations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance. with these environmental laws and regulations. Our operations involving hazardous materials also raise potential risks. of liability under common law."
15,1.0,"Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations.. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. Although we regularly monitor and review. our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations,. the risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses, as it is with other companies operating. under environmental permits."
15,0.5454545454545454,"However, future events, such as changes in, or modified interpretations of, existing environmental laws and. regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated. with the manufacture of our products and related business activities and properties, may give rise to additional. compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations."
15,0.09090909090909091,"12"
16,0.6,"In addition to environmental laws, the transportation of commodities by railcar raises potential risks in the event of. an accident that results in the release of an environmentally sensitive substance. Generally, liability under existing. laws for a derailment or other accident depends upon causation analysis and the acts, errors, or omissions, if any, of. a party involved in the transportation activity, including, but not limited to, the railroad, the shipper, the buyer and seller. of the substances being transported, or the manufacturer of the railcar, or its components. Additionally, the severity of. injury or property damage arising from an incident may influence the causation responsibility analysis, exposing the. Company to potentially greater liability. Under certain circumstances, strict liability concepts may apply and if we are. found liable in any such incident, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and. operations."
16,1.0,"We operate in highly competitive industries. We may not be able to sustain our market leadership positions,. which may impact our financial results."
16,0.8,"We face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate. In addition. to price, we face competition in respect to product performance and technological innovation, quality, reliability of. delivery, customer service, and other factors. The effects of this competition, which is often intense, could reduce our. revenues and operating profits, limit our ability to grow, increase pricing pressure on our products, and otherwise affect. our financial results."
16,0.9,"The limited number of customers for certain of our products, the variable purchase patterns of our customers. in all of our segments, and the timing of completion, delivery, and customer acceptance of orders may cause. our revenues and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter, potentially resulting in significant. fluctuations in our quarterly results."
16,0.2,"Some of the markets we serve have a limited number of customers. The volumes purchased by customers in each. of our business segments vary from year to year, and not all customers make purchases every year. As a result, the. order levels for our products have varied significantly from quarterly period to quarterly period in the past and may. continue to vary significantly in the future. Therefore, our results of operations in any particular quarterly period may. also vary. As a result of these quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results. between quarterly periods may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance."
16,0.7,"Our access to capital may be limited or unavailable due to deterioration of conditions in the global capital. markets, weakening of macroeconomic conditions, and negative changes in our credit ratings."
16,0.4,"In general, the Company, and more specifically its leasing subsidiaries' operations, relies in large part upon banks. and capital markets to fund its operations and contractual commitments and refinance existing debt. These markets. can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for extended periods of time. In addition. to conditions in the capital markets, a number of other factors could cause the Company to incur increased borrowing. costs and have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt. These. factors include the Company's financial performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook as determined primarily. by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and Fitch. Ratings, Inc. If the Company is unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, the Company's other sources of funds,. including available cash, bank facilities, and cash flow from operations may not be adequate to fund its operations and. contractual commitments and refinance existing debt."
16,0.5,"We have indebtedness which could have negative consequences on our business or results of operations."
16,0.3,"We have indebtedness both at the parent level and at the subsidiary level. Our level of indebtedness could have a. material adverse effect on our business and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding. indebtedness and notes. As a result of our debt and debt service obligations, we face increased risks regarding, among. other things, the following: (i) borrowing additional amounts or refinancing existing indebtedness may be limited or. more costly; (ii) our available cash flow after satisfying our debt obligations due to a portion of our cash flow being. needed to pay principal and interest on our debt; (iii) being at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors. that have greater financial resources or more flexible capital structures than us; (iv) our exposure to increased interest. rates for our borrowings that are at variable interest rates; (v) restrictive covenants under our indebtedness restricting. our financial and operating flexibility; and (iv) although the parent entity has not secured any debt with its assets, our. subsidiaries that have issued debt have pledged their specific assets to secure such indebtedness, and such assets. could be foreclosed upon in connection with an event of default."
16,0.1,"13"
17,0.8888888888888888,"The phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the replacement of LIBOR with a different. reference rate may have an adverse effect on our business."
17,0.2222222222222222,"On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced. that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Certain of our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness utilize LIBOR or. an alternative benchmark reference rate for calculating the applicable interest rate. After LIBOR is phased out, the. interest rates for these obligations might be subject to change. The replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark. or lender calculated index rate may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs under these. agreements and any future agreements. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash. flows, ability to acquire debt financing, and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the elimination of LIBOR or the. establishment and use of alternative benchmark reference rates and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital."
17,0.33333333333333337,"We may be unable to maintain railcar assets on lease at satisfactory lease rates."
17,0.6666666666666667,"The profitability of our railcar leasing business depends on our ability to lease railcars at satisfactory lease rates, to. re-lease railcars at satisfactory lease rates upon the expiration and non-renewal of existing leases, and to sell railcars. in the secondary market as part of our ordinary course of business. Our ability to accomplish these objectives is. dependent upon several factors, including, among others:"
17,1.0,"• the cost of and demand for leases or ownership of newer or specific-use railcar types; . • the general availability in the market of competing used or new railcars;. • the degree of obsolescence of leased or unleased railcars, including railcars subject to regulatory. obsolescence; . • the prevailing market and economic conditions, including the availability of credit, interest rates, and inflation. rates;. • the market demand or governmental mandate for refurbishment; and. • the volume and nature of railcar traffic and loadings."
17,0.4444444444444444,"A downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase. our exposure to re-marketing risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms or newer railcars, requiring us. to re-market leased railcars more frequently. Furthermore, the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited. number of potential buyers. Our inability to re-lease or sell leased or unleased railcars on favorable terms could result. in lower lease rates, lower lease utilization percentages, and reduced revenues and operating profit."
17,0.7777777777777777,"Fluctuations in the price and supply of raw materials and parts and components used in the production of. our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost-effectively manufacture and sell our. products. In some instances, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and parts and. components needed in our production."
17,0.5555555555555556,"A significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty and other parts and. components at competitive prices such as brakes, wheels, side frames, bolsters, and bearings for the railcar business.. Our manufacturing operations partially depend on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials, parts, and. components in acceptable quantities and quality from our suppliers. Certain raw materials and parts and components. for our products are currently available from a limited number of suppliers and, as a result, we may have limited control. over pricing, availability, and delivery schedules. If we are unable to purchase a sufficient quantity of raw materials. and parts and components on a timely basis, we could face disruptions in our production and incur delays while we. attempt to engage alternative suppliers. Worsening economic or commercial conditions could reduce the number of. available suppliers, potentially increasing our rejections for poor quality and requiring us to source unknown and distant. supply alternatives. Any such disruption or conditions could harm our business and adversely impact our results of. operations."
17,0.1111111111111111,"14"
18,1.0,"Reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating. costs."
18,0.5555555555555556,"We use various gases, including natural gas, at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport. our products to customers and to operate our plant equipment. An outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the. U.S. and any foreign power and, in particular, prolonged conflicts could result in a real or perceived shortage of. petroleum and/or natural gas, which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general. Extreme. weather conditions and natural occurrences such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, or a pandemic, could result. in varying states of disaster and a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and/or natural gas, including rationing. thereof, potentially resulting in an increase in natural gas prices or general energy costs. Speculative trading in energy. futures in the world markets could also result in an increase in natural gas and general energy cost. Future limitations. on the availability (including limitations imposed by increased regulation or restrictions on rail, road, and pipeline. transportation of energy supplies) or consumption of petroleum products and/or an increase in energy costs, particularly. natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment, could have an adverse effect upon. our ability to conduct our business cost effectively."
18,0.6666666666666667,"Our manufacturer's warranties expose us to product replacement and repair claims."
18,0.4444444444444444,"Depending on the product, we warrant our workmanship and certain materials (including surface coatings, primers,. sealants, and interior linings), parts, and components pursuant to express limited contractual warranties. We may be. subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout. our production process or claims for which the cost of repairing or replacing the defective part, component or material. is highly disproportionate to the original price. These types of warranty claims could result in significant costs associated. with product recalls or product repair or replacement, and damage to our reputation."

18,0.2222222222222222,"We are subject to potential liability for claims alleging property damage and personal and bodily injury or death. arising from the use of or exposure to our products, especially in connection with products we manufacture that our. customers install along U.S. highways or that our customers use to transport hazardous, flammable, toxic, or explosive. materials. As insurance policies expire, premiums for renewed or new coverage may increase and/or require that we. increase our self-insured retention or deductibles. The Company maintains primary coverage and excess coverage. policies. If the number of claims or the dollar amounts of any such claims rise in any policy year, we could suffer. additional costs associated with accessing our excess coverage policies. Also, an increase in the loss amounts. attributable to such claims could expose us to uninsured damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against. certain claims because of high premiums or other reasons. While our liability insurance coverage is at or above typical. levels for our industries, an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims coupled with an unusually large damage. award could exceed our available insurance coverage. In addition, the availability of, and our ability to collect on,. insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control, including positions on policy coverage taken by. insurers. If any of our third-party insurers fail, cancel, or refuse coverage, or otherwise are unable to provide us with. adequate insurance coverage, then our risk exposure and our operational expenses may increase and the management. of our business operations would be disrupted. Moreover, any accident or incident involving our industries in general. or us or our products specifically, even if we are fully insured, contractually indemnified, or not held to be liable, could. negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete. effectively, and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future."

Political, legal, trade, economic change or instability, criminal activities or social unrest could limit or curtail. our respective foreign business activities and operations, including the ability to hire and retain employees. We have. not, to date, been materially affected by any of these risks, but we cannot predict the likelihood of future effects from. such risks or any resulting adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Many items. manufactured by us in Mexico are sold in the U.S. and the transportation and import of such products may be disrupted.. Some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate products sold or used in those. countries. If we fail to comply with the applicable regulations within the foreign countries where we operate, we may. be unable to market and sell our products in those countries. In addition, with respect to operations in foreign countries,. unexpected changes in laws, rules, and regulatory requirements; tariffs and other trade barriers, including regulatory. initiatives for buying goods produced in America; more stringent or restrictive laws, rules, and regulations relating to. labor or the environment; adverse tax consequences; price exchange controls; and restrictions or regulations affecting. cross-border rail and vehicular traffic could limit operations affecting production throughput and making the manufacture. and distribution of our products less timely or more difficult. Furthermore, any material change in the quotas, regulations,. or duties on imports imposed by the U.S. government and agencies, or on exports by the government of Mexico or its. agencies, could affect our ability to export products that we manufacture in Mexico. Because we have operations. outside the U.S., we could be adversely affected by final judgments of non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt. Practices Act or import/export rules and regulations and similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or import/export laws of. other countries."

Such periods could negatively impact U.S. domestic and global financial markets thereby. reducing customer demand for our products and services and potentially result in reductions in our revenues, increased. price competition, or increased operating costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations,. and financial condition. We produce many of our products at our manufacturing facilities in Mexico. Our business. benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The United States,. Mexico, and Canada have reached a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which would replace NAFTA. The. USMCA would maintain duty-free access for many products. The USMCA still requires approval from Canada's. Parliament before it takes effect.

A halt of production. at any of our manufacturing facilities could severely affect delivery times to our customers. While we maintain emergency. response and business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters that could disrupt. our business, we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters.. In addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters,. which may adversely affect our financial condition.

Some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred. to as greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) which include carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the. Earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes. Additionally, we periodically review the potential challenges and. opportunities for the Company that climate change policy and legislation may pose. However, any such challenges or. opportunities are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it. applies to our industries."
21,0.5,"In response to an emerging scientific and political consensus, legislation and new rules to regulate emission of. GHGs have been introduced in numerous state legislatures, the U.S. Congress, and by the USEPA.

While Trinity cannot assess the direct impact of these or other potential regulations, it does recognize that. new climate change protocols could affect demand for its products and/or affect the price of materials, input factors,. and manufactured components. Potential opportunities could include greater demand for certain types of railcars,. while potential challenges could include decreased demand for certain types of railcars or other products and higher. energy costs. Other adverse consequences of climate change could include an increased frequency of severe weather. events and rising sea levels that could affect operations at our manufacturing facilities, the price of insuring company. assets, or other unforeseen disruptions of the Company’s operations, systems, property, or equipment.

Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported. value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult,. subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting standard setters and those. who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public. Company Accounting Oversight Board, and our independent registered public accounting firm) may amend or even. reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be. difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations..

However, third parties could also seek to hold Trinity. responsible for liabilities that Arcosa has agreed to assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from. Arcosa will be sufficient to protect Trinity against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Arcosa will be able to fully. satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, insurers may attempt to deny coverage to Trinity for liabilities. associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the spin-off."
25,1.0,"If the distribution of shares of Arcosa, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a. transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Trinity stockholders at the time of. the distribution and Trinity could be subject to significant tax liability."
25,0.2222222222222222,"In connection with the distribution of shares in Arcosa, we obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS (the IRS. Ruling) and opinions from tax advisors (the Tax Opinions), in each case substantially to the effect that, among other. things, the distribution of shares in Arcosa, together with certain related transactions, qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal. income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. (the “Code”). The IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings. from Trinity and Arcosa, including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses. and other matters. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the Tax Opinions, the IRS could determine that the distribution. or any such related transaction is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or. undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including. if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the Tax Opinions that are not covered by the IRS Ruling."
25,0.5555555555555556,"If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a stockholder of Trinity that has. received shares of Arcosa common stock in the distribution would be treated as having received a distribution of. property in an amount equal to the fair value of such Arcosa shares on the distribution date and could incur significant. income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of Trinity's. current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any amount that exceeded Trinity's earnings and profits would be treated. first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of Trinity stock, with. any remaining amount being taxed as capital gain. Trinity would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the. excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of Arcosa common stock held by Trinity on the distribution date. over Trinity's tax basis in such shares. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment. under federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, Trinity could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S.. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law."
25,0.8888888888888888,"The spin-off and related internal restructuring transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising. out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements."
25,0.7777777777777777,"The spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent. conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual. intent to hinder, delay, or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than. reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately. capitalized, or unable to pay its debts as they become due. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a. creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or Arcosa or any of. our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the spin-off or any of the related transactions constituted. a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies,. including, without limitation, voiding the distribution and returning Arcosa’s assets or Arcosa’s shares and subject. us to liability."
25,0.4444444444444444,"The distribution of Arcosa common stock is also subject to state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Delaware. General Corporation Law (DGCL), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its. surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which. the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although Trinity made the distribution of Arcosa common. stock entirely out of surplus, Trinity cannot ensure that a court would reach the same conclusion in determining the. availability of funds for the separation and the distribution to our stockholders."

In October. 2019, TRL-2019 issued an additional $386.5 million of TRL-2019 Secured Railcar Equipment Notes, consisting of two. classes of notes. These notes have a stated final maturity date of 2049."

32,0.7,"Cyclical and Seasonal Trends Impacting Our Business"
32,0.9,"The industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature. Weaknesses in certain sectors of the North American and. global economy may make it more difficult to sell or lease certain types of railcars. Additionally, adverse changes in. commodity prices or lower demand for certain commodities could result in a decline in customer demand for various. types of railcars. We continuously assess demand for our products and services and take steps to rationalize and. diversify our leased railcar portfolio and align our manufacturing capacity appropriately. We diligently evaluate the. creditworthiness of our customers and monitor performance of relevant market sectors; however, weaknesses in any. of these market sectors could affect the financial viability of our underlying Leasing Group customers, which could. negatively impact our recurring leasing revenues and operating profits. Due to their transactional nature, railcar sales. from the lease fleet are the primary driver of fluctuations in results in the Leasing Group. Results in our All Other Group. are affected by seasonal fluctuations, with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest. revenues."
32,0.3,"29"
33,0.8,"Recent Market Developments"
33,0.6,"Demand for railcars weakened in 2019 due to uncertainty associated with global tariffs and trade policies and declining. industrial production. These economic factors, combined with declining railcar loading volumes and a growing supply. of underutilized railcar assets in North America, are pressuring railcar lease rates and utilization, as well as orders for. new railcar equipment. We currently expect this trend to continue in the near term. We believe that our integrated rail. platform is designed to respond to cyclical changes in demand and perform throughout the railcar cycle."
33,0.2,"Restructuring Activities"
33,1.0,"In the fourth quarter of 2019, we implemented the initial phase of efforts to streamline certain functions to support. our rail-focused strategy and to begin disposing of underutilized assets and facilities. In connection with our assessment. of future needs to support our go-forward business strategy, we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately. $14.7 million, primarily from write-downs related to underutilized assets associated with our non-operational facilities,. and employee transition costs. We estimate that these actions will generate future annualized cost savings of. approximately $8 million to $10 million. We expect to identify additional streamlining and cost savings opportunities in. 2020."

Additionally, revenues increased in the Rail Products Group as a result of favorable product mix on external. railcar sales, higher unit deliveries and growth in our maintenance services business."
35,0.8484848484848484,"Cost of revenues — Our cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $2,365.7 million, representing. an increase of $426.9 million, or 22.0%, over the prior year. The increase in cost of revenues in our Rail Products. Group resulted primarily from product mix changes on external railcar sales and higher volumes in our maintenance. services business. Additionally, cost of revenues increased in the Leasing Group due to a higher volume of railcars. sold, including cost of revenues attributable to sales-type leases, and increased depreciation expense associated with. the growth of our lease fleet."

Revenues related to sales of leased railcars owned one year or less. increased due to a higher volume and mix of railcars sold from the fleet.

Operating profit increased by 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year primarily. due to higher profits from railcar sales, growth in the lease fleet, and lower rent expense resulting from the purchase. of 6,779 railcars during the first quarter of 2019, which were previously under lease and are now wholly-owned. These. increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense associated with the growth in the lease fleet.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates. made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

55,0.5,"Defined Benefit Pension Obligation"
55,1.0,"Description. of the Matter. At December 31, 2019, the Company’s defined benefit pension obligation was $557.9 million, and. the fair value of pension plan assets were $548.5 million, resulting in an unfunded defined benefit. pension obligation of $9.4 million. As described in Note 1 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial. statements, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the Trinity Industries, Inc. Consolidated. Pension Plan (the Pension Plan), effective December 31, 2019. Except for retirees currently receiving. payments under the Pension Plan, participants will have the choice of receiving a single lump sum. payment or an annuity from a highly-rated insurance company that will pay and administer future. benefit payments. The Pension Plan is expected to be settled between late 2020 and early 2021,. subject to required governmental approvals. The Company’s costs and liabilities related to the defined. benefit pension obligation are primarily determined using actuarial assumptions regarding the. expected rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the present value of future. obligations, and demographic assumptions regarding participant behavior, as well as assumptions. related to the rate of election by participants to receive lump sum payments or annuities upon. termination of the defined benefit pension plan in 2020 or 2021..  . Auditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of. the actuarial assumptions, specifically the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and lump. sum election rate for vested participants used in the Company’s measurement process. These. assumptions had a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation.. How We. Addressed. the Matter in. Our Audit"
55,0.875,"We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal. controls over the defined benefit pension obligation. This included management’s review of the defined. benefit pension obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions used and the data inputs. provided to the actuary."
55,0.375,"To test the defined benefit pension obligation, we performed audit procedures that included, among. others, evaluating the methodology used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above and. the underlying data used by the Company. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by. management to historical trends and evaluated the change in the defined benefit pension obligation. from the prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit. payments, contributions and the impacts to the assumptions as a result of the announced plan. termination. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating management’s. assumptions, including the methodology for determining the discount rate, the expected rate of return. on plan assets, and the lump sum election rate. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of. the underlying data, including the participant data used in the actuarial calculations."

Accordingly, Arcosa's results of operations are presented as. discontinued operations for all periods in this Form 10-K. See Note 2 for further information related to the spin-off. transaction."
61,0.8,"Revenue Recognition"
61,0.6666666666666667,"Revenue is measured based on the allocation of the transaction price in a contract to satisfied performance. obligations. The transaction price does not include any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize. revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.. Payments for our products and services are generally due within normal commercial terms. The following is a description. of principal activities from which we generate our revenue, separated by reportable segments. See Note 4 for a further. discussion regarding our reportable segments."
61,0.4,"Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group"
61,1.0,"In our Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group (Leasing Group), revenue from rentals and operating. leases, including contracts that contain non-level fixed lease payments, is recognized monthly on a straight-line basis.. Leases not classified as operating leases are generally considered sales-type leases as a result of an option to. purchase."
61,0.2,"We review our operating lease receivables for collectibility on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in. factors such as the lessee’s payment history, the financial condition of the lessee, and business and economic conditions. in the industry in which the lessee operates. In the event that the collectibility of a receivable with respect to any lessee. is no longer probable, we de-recognize the revenue and related receivable and recognize future revenue only when. the lessee makes a rental payment. Contingent rents are recognized when the contingency is resolved."
61,0.7333333333333333,"Selling profit or loss associated with sales-type leases is recognized upon lease commencement, and a net investment. in the sales-type lease is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest income related to sales-type leases. is recognized over the lease term using the effective interest method."
61,0.33333333333333337,"Revenue is recognized from the sales of railcars from the lease fleet on a gross basis in leasing revenues and cost. of revenues if the railcar has been owned for one year or less at the time of sale. Sales of railcars from the lease fleet. owned for more than one year are recognized as a net gain or loss from the disposal of a long-term asset. Revenue. from servicing and management agreements is recognized as each performance period occurs."
61,0.8666666666666667,"We account for shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good; as such, these. fees are recorded in revenue. The fees and costs of shipping and handling activities are accrued when the related. performance obligation has been satisfied."
62,0.55,"Rail Products Group"
62,0.45,"Our railcar manufacturing business recognizes revenue when the customer has submitted its certificate of acceptance. and legal title of the railcar has passed to the customer. Certain long-term contracts for the sales of railcars include. price adjustments based on steel-price indices; this amount represents variable consideration for which we are unable. to estimate the final consideration until the railcar is delivered, at which time the pricing becomes fixed."
62,0.7,"Within our maintenance services business, revenue is recognized over time as repair and maintenance projects are. completed, using an input approach based on the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs of performing the. project. We recorded contract assets of $5.2 million and $10.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively,. related to unbilled revenues recognized on repair and maintenance services that have been performed, but for which. the entire project has not yet been completed. These contract assets are included within the Receivables, net of. allowance line in our Consolidated Balance Sheets."

Some of our leases include options to extend the leases. for up to five years, and a small percentage of our leases include options to terminate within one year with certain. notice requirements and early termination penalties.

We place our cash investments in bank deposits and investment grade,. short-term debt instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial issuer. Concentrations of. credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to control procedures that monitor the credit worthiness of. customers, the large number of customers in our customer base, and their dispersion across different end markets. and geographic areas. As receivables are generally unsecured, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based. upon the expected collectibility of all receivables. Receivable balances determined to be uncollectible are charged. against the allowance.

65,0.29411764705882354,"As of early 2020, we are finalizing an assessment of the estimated useful lives and salvage value assumptions for. the railcars in our lease fleet. Based upon analysis of historical fleet data, review of industry standards, and consideration. of certain economic factors by railcar type, we have determined that it is appropriate to revise the useful lives and. salvage values of certain railcar types in our lease fleet. We believe that the revised useful lives reflect the estimated. economic lives of the railcars in our lease fleet. The net impact of these changes, which will become effective January. 1, 2020, is expected to result in a change in the weighted average useful life of railcars in our lease fleet from. approximately 34 years to approximately 37 years. This change will be accounted for as a change in accounting. estimate, which is required to be accounted for on a prospective basis. Based on the composition of the lease fleet. as of December 31, 2019, we expect this change to result in a net decrease in annual depreciation expense of between. $27 million and $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2020."

65,0.35294117647058826,"We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment. The carrying value of long-. lived assets is considered impaired when their carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash. flows and the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the. anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available.. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are. reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets. Based on our evaluations, no impairment charges were. determined to be necessary on assets held and used as of December 31, 2019 and 2018."

65,0.411764705882353,"Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances. change indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment. test is a two-step process, with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the. carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill. impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. Impairment is assessed. at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value-based test for each unit with recorded goodwill. The estimates and. judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions, consisting of level three inputs,. related to revenue and operating profit results, discount rates, terminal growth rates and exit multiples. As of. December 31, 2019 and 2018, our annual impairment test of goodwill was completed at the reporting unit level, and. no impairment charges were determined to be necessary."

67,0.6363636363636364,"ASU 2016-02 — In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, (ASC 842) which amended the. existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their. balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASC 842 is effective for public companies during. interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. In July 2018,. the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, which permitted entities to record the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the. date of adoption, with no requirement to recast comparative periods."
67,0.2727272727272727,"We adopted ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019 using the optional transition method of recognizing a cumulative-. effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2019. Therefore, comparative financial. information was not adjusted and continues to be reported under the prior lease accounting guidance in ASC 840. We. elected the transition relief package of practical expedients, and as a result, we did not assess 1) whether existing or. expired contracts contain embedded leases, 2) lease classification for any existing or expired leases, and 3) whether. lease origination costs qualified as initial direct costs. We elected the short-term lease practical expedient by establishing. an accounting policy to exclude leases with a term of 12 months or less, as well as the land easement practical. expedient for maintaining our current accounting policy for existing or expired land easements. For qualifying operating. leases in which we are the lessor, we do not separate lease components for our leased railcars from non-lease. components, which are comprised of stand-ready maintenance obligations. We did not elect the practical expedient. to use hindsight in determining a lease term and impairment of right-of-use assets at the adoption date."
67,0.7272727272727273,"Upon adoption, we recognized right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $47.0 million and $48.3. million, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet based on the present value of future minimum lease payments. under operating leases for which we are the lessee. This excluded the impact of railcars that were previously under. operating leases as of January 1, 2019 but which were purchased on January 14, 2019 and are now wholly-owned. by our Leasing Group. Additionally, we recorded an adjustment to opening retained earnings of $17.7 million ($13.7. million, net of tax) related to the derecognition of deferred profit related to sale-leaseback transactions. Our accounting. treatment under ASC 842 for leases in which we are the lessor remained substantially unchanged from our accounting. treatment under ASC 840. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of. operations or cash flows."

Services Group, which owns and operates a fleet of railcars and provides third-party fleet leasing, management, and. administrative services; (2) the Rail Products Group, which manufactures and sells railcars and related parts and. components, and provides railcar maintenance and modification services; and (3) All Other. The All Other segment. includes our highway products business; our logistics business; legal, environmental, and maintenance costs. associated with non-operating facilities; and other peripheral businesses. Gains and losses from the sale of property,. plant, and equipment are included in the operating profit of each respective segment. Our Chief Operating Decision. Maker (CODM) regularly reviews the operating results of our reportable segments in order to assess performance. and allocate resources. Our CODM does not consider restructuring activities when evaluating segment operating. results; therefore, restructuring activities are not allocated to segment profit or loss."

Sales between these groups are recorded at prices comparable to those charged to external customers,. taking into consideration quantity, features, and production demand. Amortization of deferred profit on railcars sold to. the Leasing Group is included in the operating profit of the Leasing Group, resulting in the recognition of depreciation. expense based on our original manufacturing cost of the railcars.

These wholly-owned subsidiaries are TRIP Master Funding (wholly-owned by. TRIP Holdings) and Trinity Rail Leasing 2012 LLC (TRL-2012, wholly-owned by RIV 2013). Railcar purchases by. these subsidiaries were funded by secured borrowings and capital contributions from TILC and third-party equity. investors. TILC is the contractual servicer for TRIP Master Funding and TRL-2012, with the authority to manage and. service each entity's owned railcars. Our controlling interest in each of TRIP Holdings and RIV 2013 results from our. combined role as both equity member and agent/servicer. The noncontrolling interest included in the accompanying. Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the non-Trinity equity interest in these partially-owned subsidiaries."

RIV 2013, when available, in proportion to its respective equity interests, and has an interest in the net assets of the. partially-owned subsidiaries upon a liquidation event in the same proportion. TILC is paid fees for the services it. provides to TRIP Master Funding and TRL-2012 and has the potential to earn certain incentive fees. TILC and the. third-party equity investors have commitments to provide additional equity funding to TRIP Holdings that are scheduled. to expire in May 2021, contingent upon certain returns on investment in TRIP Holdings and other conditions being. met.

Each of the Trusts financed. the purchase of the railcars with a combination of debt and equity. In each transaction, the equity participant in each. of the respective Trusts was considered to be the primary beneficiary of the Trust; and therefore, the accounts of the. Trusts, including the debt related to each of the Trusts, were not included as part of the Consolidated Financial. Statements. The Leasing Group, through wholly-owned, qualified subsidiaries, leased railcars from the Trusts under. operating leases with terms of twenty-two years, and subleased the railcars to independent third-party customers. under shorter term operating lease agreements. The terms of the operating lease agreements between the subsidiaries. and the remaining Trusts provided the Leasing Group with the option to purchase, at a predetermined fixed price,. certain railcars from the remaining Trusts in 2019. On January 14, 2019, we completed the purchase for a purchase. price of $218.4 million. As a result, 6,779 railcars previously under lease are now wholly-owned by our Leasing Group..

85,0.5714285714285715,"On September 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the termination of the Trinity Industries, Inc. Consolidated. Pension Plan (the Pension Plan), effective December 31, 2019. Except for retirees currently receiving payments. under the Pension Plan, participants will have the choice of receiving a single lump sum payment or an annuity from. a highly-rated insurance company that will pay and administer future benefit payments. The Pension Plan is expected. to be settled between late 2020 and early 2021, subject to required governmental approvals, and would then result in. the Company no longer having any remaining funded pension plan obligations."
85,0.7142857142857143,"Upon settlement, we expect to incur pre-tax pension settlement charges totaling between $155 million and $185. million. The settlement charges will be recognized in our Statement of Operations in two phases, with the first charge. to be recognized when payments are made to those participants electing to receive a lump sum distribution, and the. second charge to be recognized when the annuity contracts are purchased to settle all remaining outstanding pension. obligations. The range of settlement charges includes: (1) a non-cash charge for the recognition of all pre-tax actuarial. losses accumulated in AOCL related to the Pension Plan, which totaled approximately $170.1 million ($131.2 million,. net of tax) as of December 31, 2019; and (2) a potential additional cash contribution to settle all of the Pension Plan’s. obligations, which is not expected to exceed $15.0 million. The actual amount of the settlement charges and any. potential cash contribution will depend on interest rates, Pension Plan asset returns, the lump-sum election rate, and. other factors."
85,0.8095238095238095,"In anticipation of the planned settlement of the Pension Plan, our benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019 were. valued based on the amounts expected to be required to settle these obligations, which included assumptions regarding. the portion of obligations expected to be settled through lump sum payments or annuity contracts, and the current. estimates of the cost to purchase such annuity contracts."

Arcosa in connection with the spin-off, but Trinity retained the pension plan. Effective as of November 1, 2018, all participants in this plan have been. granted the maximum benefit allowed under the plan; therefore, the compensation increase rate is not applicable."
86,0.72,"The obligation discount rate assumption is determined by deriving a single discount rate from a theoretical settlement. portfolio of high quality corporate bonds sufficient to provide for the plans' projected benefit payments. The expected. long-term rate of return on the plans' assets is an assumption reflecting the anticipated weighted average rate of. earnings on the portfolio over the long-term. To arrive at this rate, estimates were developed based upon the anticipated. performance of the plans' assets. Substantially all of the accrued benefits of our remaining pension plans were frozen. in 2009, with all qualified pension plans frozen as of December 31, 2019."
