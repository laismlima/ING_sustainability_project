3,0.3,"Potential for Tax Basis Adjustments"
3,0.65,"The PV Systems were financed via limited liability companies (each a “Project Company”) whose . membership and economic interests are divided between a managing member and the related tax . equity investor (other than with respect to Owner VIII, which is owned solely by its managing . member). Each Project Company holds the right to an investment tax credit (“ITC”) in an amount . that is based on the purchase price of the PV Systems it owns. This is equal to the fair market . value (“FMV”) of the related PV Systems at the time of purchase, as established by an appraisal. . The tax equity investor maintains its substantial interest in the Project Company until the “flip . date”, which, depending on the tax equity fund, occurs either on a specified date or once the tax . equity investor realizes a specified rate of return.  .  . To the extent an IRS challenge results in an adjustment in the FMV of the PV Systems relating to . Fund 26, Vivint Solar effectively indemnifies the tax equity investor for the loss of ITCs. The Project . Company will have the benefit of a tax loss insurance policy to cover any such tax loss. For Fund . 26, Vivint Solar is the named insured, while Fund 26 is an additional insured. In general, the tax . loss insurance policy covers tax loss payments to the tax equity investor in an amount equal to a . minimum of 36% of the ITCs claimed by Fund 26 with respect to the PV Systems and fees and . expenses (“Contest Costs”) incurred by the Project Company related to its defense or appeal . against such fair market value related claim by the IRS.  .  . The insurer will be AIG Specialty Insurance Company (the “Tax Loss Insurer”) for Fund 26. KBRA . has performed a credit estimate of the Tax Loss Insurer and does not view its creditworthiness to . be a constraint on the rating of the notes, although it should be noted that the transaction . documents will not require the replacement of an insurer if an insurer is downgraded by one or . more credit rating agencies. .  .  ."

4,0.6111111111111112,"Refund Payments May Reduce Available Cash Flow"
4,0.38888888888888884,"The majority of PV Systems under lease agreements contain a minimum performance guaranty . that entitles the underlying customer to a performance guaranty payment from Vivint Solar to the . extent that the cumulative energy production for the PV System during a specified period is less . than the contractual guaranteed amount at that point. Moreover, the amount of the payment . usually contains an annual escalator to account for the anticipated annual increase in costs . associated with obtaining energy from a traditional utility provider to supplement the energy . deficit. While performance guaranty payments are obligations of Vivint Solar, KBRA assumed in its . analysis that cash flow from the transaction would be used for these payments. Consequently, . prolonged underperformance of PV Systems under lease agreements will lead to increasing . performance guaranty payments over time, which would adversely impact available cash flow to . service interest and principal of the rated Notes.  .  . The expected performance of the PV Systems was estimated by Leidos Engineering, LLC, an . independent engineer. Per the independent engineer’s report, the PV Systems’ average energy . production as of October 2020 is 98.2% of expected output, while the annual degradation of this . output is 0.75% per annum. However, under the A- rating scenario KBRA assumes the PV Systems . will operate at a P90 generation profile with an annual degradation rate of 1.15% per annum. . KBRA’s rating analysis results in a performance guaranty payment of approximately $3.6 million . under KBRA’s A- scenario. KBRA notes that lease agreements constitute only 15.3% of the . collateral by ADSAB, thus limiting the magnitude of potential refund payments."

The total period of 360 days until recognition of a default is . twice as long as the generally accepted standard timeframe for most consumer assets. On the next . payment date after a default is recognized, 75% of the DSAB from the defaulted PV System prior to . the recognition of the default is payable to the Notes, thereby accelerating the repayment of debt in an . amount determined by the lost cash flows from related defaulted contracts. .  . Despite the atypical default recognition policy, the impact of non-payment by any underlying customer . is captured in the debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) calculation.

The percentage . of customers who are enrolled to pay their solar bill through ACH is approximately 80% as of . December 2020 and has increased slightly since December 2019. .  . In order to test the transaction’s strength against a potential COVID-19 impact, KBRA ran . sensitivity scenarios in which the credit default timing curve was compressed from 10 years to 5 . years for all rating scenarios. These COVID-19 sensitivity runs further reduced cash flow available . to service the debt.

Following the audit, the IRS may formally challenge the FMV calculation. The IRS must submit its challenge within three . years following the filing of a Project Company’s tax return. If a challenge is made during this period, the statute of . limitations tolls until a decision is made regarding the challenge. The minimum expected duration of an ITC challenge . until resolution is approximately four years. Cash flow received by the Issuer from payments under the lease and PPA . agreements would still be available to service interest and principal payments on the Notes during an IRS challenge. .  . To the extent an IRS challenge results in an adjustment in the FMV, Vivint Solar will have to repay the tax equity 30¢ . for every $1 reduction in the FMV. To mitigate against any reduction in the distributions to the managing members . associated with potential IRS recapture of ITCs, the tax loss insurance policy for Fund 26 names Vivint Solar as insured. . The premiums for the tax loss insurance policies are single non-refundable premiums that have been paid prior to the . closing date. .  . The maximum protection provided by each tax loss insurance policy represents a portion of the ITCs claimed by each . Project Company.

The total insured liability for ITC-related claims for Fund 27 is $10,035,501. .  . KBRA performed a credit assessment of the insurance provider for Fund 26 and determined that it has investment grade . credit characteristics. However, the transaction does not provide for a replacement mechanism or any structural . protections in the event the insurance provider is downgraded by one or more credit rating agencies. .  . KBRA notes that the tax loss insurance policies only protect against tax losses and Contest Costs in an amount that is . a portion of the ITCs claimed by each of the Project Companies for the related PV Systems. Based on KBRA’s valuation . approach of the PV Systems, it is not anticipated that any adjustment to the FMV of the PV Systems would result in the . sum of the Contest Costs and tax loss payments to exceed this amount.

10,0.4444444444444444,". Production Estimate . The amount of energy output from a solar system is dependent upon the solar resource. Vivint Solar engaged Leidos . Engineering, LLC (“Independent Engineer” or “IE”) to evaluate its solar resource assessment that is a primary input into . its pro forma forecast. The solar resource assessment is based on using the Company’s forecasting engine, which . incorporates elements of Cobblestone and Project Sunroof.  .  . The IE evaluated the production performance of a representative portion of Vivint Solar’s fleet of PV Systems. The . production data obtained by the IE was then compared to Vivint Solar’s original forecast, which is consistent with a P50 . generation profile. P50 production is the median expected production of a PV System. Based on the IE’s findings, the . average production of the portfolio of PV Systems as of October 2020 was 98.2% of the P50 production estimate. .  . KBRA Production Estimate . Probability of exceedance values (“P-values”) provide insight into the volatility of the solar resource over a given period. . Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate P-values for the portfolio’s energy production. A one-year P-value . represents the probability of exceedance for any given individual year. For example, the actual energy production for . any given year is equally likely to be higher or lower than the P50 value. Similarly, a multi-year P-value represents the . probability of exceedance for any given multi-year (i.e., the average energy production for a given 10-year period is . 90% likely to exceed to the 10-year P90). KBRA analyzed the securitization’s cash flows under a one-year P90 to account . for the use of satellite data and uncertainty imbedded in the solar resource forecast. However, unlike large scale utility . projects, the securitization benefits from a portfolio effect, which should result in a reduction in inter-annual variability . as poor production in one region might be offset by stronger production in another area.  .  . KBRA’s rating stress incorporates a reduction in each system’s availability rate in order to account for the risk that the . systems are offline for a given period of time and unable to produce power. KBRA uses a 1.15% per annum degradation . assumption under the A- rating scenario to account for the risk that the amount of energy the system can produce . deteriorates over time. It should be noted that KBRA’s 1.15% per annum degradation assumptions are substantially . higher than the IE’s base case assumption of 0.75% per annum. .  .  ."

All inverters and batteries are . expected to be replaced over the tenor of the transaction given KBRA’s useful life assumption of 10-15 years. While it . is likely that the MSA fee payment compensates it for this expense, KBRA has made the assumption that Vivint Solar . Provider’s credit quality is weaker than the Notes and at some point it is replaced. As such, KBRA believes the Issuer . will be responsible for these maintenance expenses and has included this as an expense in its ratings stresses.  .  . Vivint Solar Provider’s MSAs provide for a fixed annual fee of $16.50 (or, in the case of the Owner VIII fund, $21.00) . and ASAs provide for a fixed annual fee of $4.50 per year (except for the Owner VIII fund) per DC kilowatt of installed . nameplate capacity, both of which increase annually by 2.0%. However, KBRA’s rating scenarios utilize higher rates (A- . stress scenario: $27/kW) which KBRA believes are needed to attract a new O&M provider in a distressed scenario. Wells . Fargo Bank, National Association will serve as the Transition Manager and will have the responsibility of identifying a . replacement manager in a default scenario. Noteholder approval of the new manager is also required. KBRA views the . inclusion of the Transition Manager favorably as it allows the securitization to continue to operate as expected if Vivint . Solar Provider as manager needs to be replaced. .  . Summary of Collateral .

The first component (15.29%) was calculated by doubling the PD . output determined by KBRA RMBS Credit Model, based on each obligor’s FICO score.

16,0.36363636363636365,". Clean Source of Energy . Photovoltaic solar systems provide a clean and renewable form of energy as an alternative to energy sources that . produce carbon emissions such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum. Furthermore, in many instances solar energy has . proven to be more cost-effective for consumers than other major sources of energy, making the choice of installing . solar more appealing. While KBRA views the growth of clean energy as a positive environmental factor, KBRA tests the . persistence of the savings offered to the homeowner under the PPA or lease contract relative to the costs from traditional . sources of energy. Please refer to the Cash Flow Assumptions section for the additional information regarding the value . proposition stresses that KBRA applies. Generally, KBRA projects the contracts that will have their value proposition . eroded at multiple points in time. As a result of the decline in savings, KBRA assumes that a portion of those contracts . is assumed to renegotiate to a lower contract rate in order to reestablish the value proposition originally provided by . the solar system.  ."

Demographic trends drive consumer preferences and the overall direction of the economy, which influences the demand . for products and performance of financial assets. Changes in demographic trends and consumer preferences impact the . long-term viability of the product and Company. KBRA considers changes in demographic trends, consumer preferences . and the long-term viability of the product and Company in its rating assessment. Products with low customer satisfaction, . that are inefficient or have not embraced technological developments have a greater likelihood of being disintermediated . or replaced by newer products that address these factors. Demand for financial products are also affected by population . growth and consumers’ age, demographic changes, employment rates, consumer behavior and other secular trends.  ."
16,0.8181818181818181,"Governance Factors"
16,0.5454545454545454,". Experience of Management, Historical Performance . KBRA believes Sunrun’s management team has the knowledge and industry experience mange the company’s . operations, underwrite loans in accordance with their credit policy and to service the securitized pool. .  . Historical performance data, which includes defaults, recoveries and prepayments, are important considerations used . to predict future performance of the underlying assets. Sunrun has limited operating history for its originations, servicing . and underwriting criteria used to originate the solar contracts held as collateral in this securitization. .  . Transaction Structure . Transaction structure is an important governance factor in structured finance transactions as many structural aspects, . such as adherence to representations and warranties, compliance with origination standards and eligibility criteria, . reporting of collateral performance, and segregation and application of cashflows, require parties to act in good faith . and certify the accuracy of such information. Failure to do so could impact actual performance and KBRA’s ratings. KBRA . considers the transaction structural features such as, but not limited to: cash management arrangements; primary . servicer’s capabilities; back-up servicer arrangements; reserve requirements for upfront and ongoing obligations; . waterfall provisions; the bankruptcy remoteness of the Issuer; and underlying collateral for the debt; as applicable, in . our ratings analysis.
