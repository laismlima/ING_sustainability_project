0,0.45833333333333337,"GoodGreen 2020-1 is a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) created to issue $318.087 million in private placement series . 2020-1 notes secured by a portfolio of property-assessed clean energy (PACE) assets in California, Florida, and . Missouri. PACE programs allow for low-cost financing of a variety of energy efficiency, renewable energy, water . conservation, storm protection, and seismic improvements on residential and commercial properties that are repaid . through a special tax or an annual or semiannual assessment on a property’s tax bill. Ygrene Energy Fund Inc. . (Ygrene), the transaction sponsor, is a financing company that provides residential, multifamily, and commercial . property PACE financing throughout the U.S. Ygrene provides collateral in the form of the PACE asset portfolio and . uses the liens and tax payments to support the securitization. The notes are nonrecourse obligations of GoodGreen . 2020-1 and are payable solely from the PACE assets. For purposes of this evaluation, we assess the technologies in . the underlying collateral assets, which include building refurbishment, solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, water . efficiency retrofits, and energy efficiency measures. The pool also includes seismic improvements, alternative . energy, and other projects that are not in scope for our Green Evaluation but are eligible under PACE programs. In our . view, this transaction is aligned with the Green Bond Principles 2018 (GBP)."

1,0.6666666666666667,"Project Description"
1,0.41666666666666663,"GoodGreen 2020-1 will use the note proceeds to acquire and . securitize a portfolio of PACE assets in California, Florida, and . Missouri. PACE programs were established by state legislation and . approved by local governments as a mechanism to provide low-cost . financing for energy and water efficiency retrofits, renewable energy . generation, storm resilience, and seismic improvements for . residential and commercial properties. The California PACE assets . are payable in equal semiannual installments, while the Florida and . Missouri PACE assets are each payable in a single annual . installment. PACE assessments have equal lien priority with real . estate taxes and constitute liens against the property."
1,0.33333333333333337,"We considered both the initial and prefunded pool in our analysis. The . prefunded pool refers to the collateral that will be purchased by the . issuer post-closing with proceeds from the securities offering that is . deposited into a prefunded account. The underlying collateral . consists mainly of residential PACE assets (84%) and commercial . assets (16%). Approximately 77% of the pool is in Florida, with the . remainder in California (22%) and Missouri (less than 1.2%). S&P . Global Ratings considers approximately 98% of the total collateral . value in our Green Evaluation for projects, excluding about 2% of . proceeds that are allocated to seismic improvements, alternative . energy, and other projects, which are out of scope for our Green . Evaluation but still eligible for PACE funding."
1,0.25,"Ygrene is a provider of residential and commercial PACE financing, . the transaction sponsor, and the originator of the PACE assets . backing the securitization. Ygrene partners with local and regional . governmental entities to administer and fund their PACE programs. . The California PACE programs were established by the Golden State . Finance Authority, the Coachella Valley Association of Governments, . and the County of Yolo. The Florida PACE Program was created by the . Green Corridor District and covers a number of counties and . municipalities within the state. The PACE assets in Missouri are . issued by the Clean Energy Development Board of the City of St. . Louis, Missouri, and the St. Louis County Clean Energy Development . Board. In order to qualify for PACE financing, property improvements . must meet program guidelines developed by each of the local . agencies. The guidelines typically restrict PACE funding to a set of . authorized improvements that conserve energy and/or water, deploy . renewable energy, and provide resilience improvements to protect . against storm damage. The programs provide clear project selection . criteria, a factor we see as beneficial to the overall governance of the . transaction under our approach. The municipalities service the PACE . assets through their annual or semiannual tax collection process and"
1,0.75,"remit payments via a trustee to the PACE bondholders. The PACE . assets serve as the collateral, and the property liens and tax . payments form the security."
1,0.5833333333333334,"At this stage, S&P Global Ratings is unable to provide its assessment . of the resilience of the projects and assets to extreme weather and . climate change as part of this Green Evaluation."
1,0.9166666666666667,"Scoring Summary"
1,0.5,"The transaction achieves an overall Green Evaluation score of E1 on . our scale of E1 (highest) to E4 (lowest) and an overall score of 75. We . derive the Green Evaluation score by weighing the mitigation score by . 60%, the Governance score by 25%, and the Transparency score by . 15%. The evaluation reflects a Mitigation score of 78, which is . supported by building refurbishment, energy efficiency, solar PV . projects, and water efficiency retrofits on residential and commercial . properties in Florida, California, and Missouri. A net benefit ranking is . calculated for each group of asset types, based on the avoided . emissions and water savings estimated for each technology type . according to the carbon intensity of the Florida, California, and . Missouri grids. On an aggregate basis, we consider the grid carbon . intensity as medium high, since approximately 77% of the pool is . located in Florida, where the grid heavily relies on natural gas for . about 70% of its net generation. The score also reflects the high . water stress of all three states, where water conservation . technologies are being installed. We then apply our hierarchy . adjustment to the net benefit rankings to reflect the role each of . these technology types play in systemic decarbonization and . sustainable water use to arrive at the Environmental Impact scores. . Finally, the net impact scores are combined, based on the projected . allocation of underlying collateral values to derive the overall . Mitigation score."
1,0.16666666666666669,"The Governance score of 81 reflects the very strong governance, . which is enabled by the defined eligibility criteria underlying the . California, Florida, and Missouri PACE programs and third-party . verification of the allocation of bond proceeds. The average . Transparency score of 57 reflects the reporting of the allocation of . proceeds on an aggregated basis by technology type and some . reporting on environmental impacts on an annual basis. But it is . limited by the requirement to disclose this information on-request to . interested parties instead of on a public website or an alternative . platform. S&P Global Ratings considers approximately 98% of the . total collateral value in our Green Evaluation for projects, excluding . about 2% of proceeds that are allocated to seismic improvements, . alternative energy, and other projects, which are out of scope for our"

2,0.41666666666666663,"Green Evaluation but still eligible for PACE funding. We assume that . the prefunded pool of assets is distributed in line with the initial . collateral pool."
2,0.25,"Rationale"
2,0.6666666666666667,"Green building refurbishment projects, account for the 77% of . the underlying collateral and ultimately drive the overall . Mitigation score. The score is largely supported by green . building projects in Florida, where approximately 77% of the . underlying collateral is located and which exhibits what we . consider medium-high grid carbon intensity. Green Building . Projects in Missouri enable the highest net benefit scores, . given the high carbon intensity of the local grid. In cases where . the net benefit ranking is very high, the hierarchy score for . refurbishment measures reduces the final environmental . impact score slightly. Approximately 17% of the underlying . collateral involves solar projects that are split among . California, Florida, and Missouri. This renewable technology is . considered a long-term green solution and is placed at the top . end of our carbon hierarchy, contributing to the overall . Mitigation score. The transaction received a strong . Governance score of 81, given the eligibility criteria . established by the PACE programs in each state and the . securitization structure, which includes representations and . warranties governing the use and management of proceeds. . The Transparency score of 57 reflects some reporting of . environmental impacts to interested parties."
2,0.8333333333333333,"Key Strengths And Weaknesses"
2,0.33333333333333337,"The types of technology financed is a key factor in the above . average Mitigation score of 78. The range of projects financed . through the PACE assets that we evaluated are mainly for . green building refurbishments, which represent 77% of the . pool and include a number of building refurbishment . measures such as wall insulation, roofing retrofits, heating, . ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) upgrades, window and . door replacement, and high efficiency LED lighting upgrades. . Renewable energy projects account for approximately 20% of . the total value of the projects evaluated and are mainly . allocated to distributed PV systems in California. These . projects are in the top rung of the carbon hierarchy due to"
2,0.5,"their high contribution to systemic decarbonization. We treat . wind resistant doors, windows, and roofing using comparable . green refurbishment proxies, given the efficiency benefits . associated with these resilience improvements. The . residential and commercial green refurbishment PACE assets . in Florida achieve the highest net benefit scores, given the . state’s reliance on fossil fuel based assets and the relatively . higher carbon emissions avoided through these efficiency . measures. The water projects support significant net benefits . because California faces high water scarcity. Certain projects . such as commercial insulations in green buildings receive a . lower net benefit ranking because of technology efficiency and . the overall grid intensity and water scarcity."
2,0.75,"The transaction's Governance and Transparency scores reflect . the proceeds allocation, management, and reporting. The . strong Governance score reflects the underlying PACE . program selection criteria, which aligns with environmental . objectives, and the securitization structure, which includes a . series of representations and warranties that govern the use . and management of proceeds. The prefunded portion of the . proceeds is held in a separate subaccount where no other . funds are commingled. The PACE guidelines include qualified . improvement types that fall into categories such as energy . efficiency, renewable energy, water management, and . emerging technology and innovative solutions that ensure that . the PACE assets supporting the securitization involve . environmentally beneficial projects. The local governmental . entities verify the PACE liens and a third-party due diligence . report is prepared for the assets at the securitization level, . which provides additional assurance that the proceeds are . funding eligible projects."
2,1.0,"The Transparency score is moderate at 57. Our analysis . considers the transaction’s requirement to report on the . allocation of proceeds and the overall environmental impact. It . also evaluates the depth of reporting, which is somewhat . lacking in terms of detailed project level environmental impact . detail."
