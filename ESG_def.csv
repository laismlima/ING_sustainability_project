"Measure And Analyze Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The first step for any company that wants to reduce its impact on the planet and the environment, and therefore help to reduce climate change, is to measure its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). For this end, there are many private agencies that are carbon footprint certified and can help companies measure their CO2 emissions. Once GHG emissions are known, they must be analyzed to see which of the company’s activities are the highest pollutants. Once this analysis is done, companies can then begin to consider solutions to reduce their emissions. "
"Reducing Energy Consumption: Turning off the lights in the office in the evening, slightly lowering the heating or the air conditioning or taking devices off the plugs when it’s not needed are some good actions companies can implement. Moreover, by paying more attention to other daily routine actions, businesses can slightly reduce their energy consumption and, thus, their impact on the climate. "
"Give Renewable Energies A Go: Today, more and more individuals are choosing renewable energy and this is also an interesting solution for companies. Suppliers such as ekWateur or Enercoop represent an interesting solution for using only 100% renewable energy. Simply put: avoiding fossil fuels significantly reduces the climate footprint. "
"Reduce Waste And Fight Obsolescence: Another way to reduce the climate footprint of a business is to reduce the amount of waste generated. Whether it is the industrial waste of a large company or the paper waste of a SME of the tertiary sector, all companies produce waste. Avoiding disposable cups, stirrers, and capsules for the coffee machine and giving kitchen crockery instead, reducing the number of prints, reusing papers as drafts, sort waste for recycling correctly… There are plenty of possible solutions depending on the facilities (office or factory) and an organization’s core business, and many employees we’ll have plenty of good suggestions if they are motivated to adopt an eco-entrepreneur mindset. It is also important to use equipments and devices properly to avoid they get deteriorated faster and to repair gadgets when they break down instead of replacing them with new ones."
"Optimize Employees’ Transportation: As we know, transportation is one of the largest sectors of greenhouse gas emissions. By encouraging employees to take public transit, to carpool with other colleagues living closeby or by giving them discounts on public transportation, companies can significantly reduce their indirect CO2 emissions and therefore their impact on climate change."
"Choose Greener Infrastructures And Equipment: It is also possible to choose more environment-friendly infrastructures and equipments. In this way, companies can set up a fleet of hybrid or even electric vehicles to renovate their employees’ cars according to the latest environmental standards. Or when the time comes to buy new printers, air conditioners, laptops, screens, bulbs or office materials, if the old ones can’t be fixed or more are needed, choose the most efficient (energy-wise) and sustainable (regarding the origin or manpower ethic standards) ones."
"Choose Sustainable Suppliers: Each company also has a responsibility regarding the partners it chooses. Choosing a supplier is also an environmentally-friendly choice (or not, depending on the supplier). Therefore, companies should make the effort to choose suppliers who demonstrate they have good environmental practices. In fact, companies wanting to get sustainability and CSR certifications such as GRI or B Corp often see their operations reviewed. And in the process, suppliers’ operations might also be accounted to a company’s own ecological footprint. Therefore, these companies aspiring certification might even need to ask their suppliers to adopt more sustainable practices (such as giving proof of not employing children and paying fair wages or disposing waste properly), or even have to change to more sustainable suppliers if the old ones refuse to change."
